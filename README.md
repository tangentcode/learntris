The LearnTris Challenge
=======================

This repository contains a series of automated tests that
will guide you through implementing your own version of
a famous falling blocks game.

The game is a fairly small project suitable for beginners
who understand the basic concepts of programming, or for
veteran developers looking to pick up a new language.

Along the way, it will expose you to some common software
engineering tools and practices that might not be familiar
to new developers.

 * version control with git
 * process automation
 * coding to an interface
 * inter-process communication
 * test-driven/behavior-driven development
 * creating a simple domain-specific language

**Note:** *This is not a tutorial.*

While the tests are "about" a video game, the real purpose 
of this exercise is to force you to "fend for yourself" on
a project, without relying on tutorial-style guidance.

Instead, the tests present a series of problems that you
will need to solve in order to implement the game.

*It is entirely up to you how to write the code.*

The tests themselves are written in python, but you are free
to implement your game in any language you like.

The first section involves setting up a simple communication
protocol so the tests can run your code, and the rest focus
on the game itself.

**Getting Started**

The first step is to clone or forth this repo and run `testris.py`.
You will need a recent version of python, preferably python3.2 or later.
(Python is *only* for the test runner. You can use any language you want to
write your implementation.)

The output of `testris.py` will tell you what needs to be done at every
step alonge the way. Just keep running it, and do what it tells you to do.

If you get stuck, please come us in #learnprogramming on irc.freenode.net, or
post a question to [/r/lpmc](http://reddit.com/r/lpmc/) at reddit, and we'll
try to help you sort it out.
