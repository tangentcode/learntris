The Learntris Challenge
=======================

This repository contains a series of automated tests that
will guide you through implementing your own version of
a famous falling blocks game.

The game is a fairly small project suitable for beginners
who understand the basic concepts of programming, or for
veteran developers looking to pick up a new language.

Along the way, it will expose you to some common software
engineering tools and practices that might not be familiar
to new developers.

 * version control with git
 * process automation
 * coding to an interface
 * inter-process communication
 * test-driven/behavior-driven development
 * creating a simple domain-specific language

**Note:** *This is not a tutorial.*

While the tests are "about" a video game, the real purpose 
of this exercise is to force you to "fend for yourself" on
a project, without relying on tutorial-style guidance.

Instead, the tests present a series of problems that you
will need to solve in order to implement the game.

*It is entirely up to you how to write the code.*

The tests themselves are written in python, but you are free
to implement your game in any language you like.

**Getting Started**

The first step is to clone or fork this repo and run `testris.py`.
You will need a recent version of python, preferably python3.2 or later.
(Python is *only* for the test runner. You can use any language you want to
write your implementation.)

The output of `testris.py` will tell you what needs to be done at every
step alonge the way. Just keep running it, and do what it tells you to do.

The wiki here has a couple pages on [Getting Set Up](https://github.com/LearnProgramming/learntris/wiki/Getting-Set-Up) and [Understanding the Test Results](https://github.com/LearnProgramming/learntris/wiki/Understanding-the-Test-results).

try to help you sort it out.
